# blSim

## Purpose

- Interface between Blender and vehicle dynamics simulation softwares through FMU

- Using Blender as visuzlization tool for pure mathematical dynamics simulations

- Using Blender for simulation scene creation for mathematical dynamics simulations

- Hope to create a more flexible tool for vehicle dynamics simulation
